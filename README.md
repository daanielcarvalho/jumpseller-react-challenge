## Challenge Overview

This is a pretty simple test, in which you should be able to write a React app, using the provided API .

You can use any boilerplate/approach you prefer, but try to keep it simple. We encourage you to use your favourite tools and packages to build a solid React application.

The purpose of this challenge is to let us know a little about your thinking and the way you approach problems. It is up to you how much effort you put into it and exactly what you deliver.

## Challenge Requirements

1. Build a simple layout to fulfill the requirements below.

## Expectations

- Write a good README with basic information on how to start the project, how to build it and the decisions you made during the implementation.
- If you build a responsive app it's a big plus. We would love to see your design skills!
- We're looking for signs you understand concepts such as events, promises, and reactivity, and how those concepts are implemented in Javascript;
- Don't overly nest your code; try to stay into smaller logical pieces.
- When creating components try to break them into separate items. Example: Header, body and footer in different self-sufficient styled elements.
- Unit testing will be greatly valued.
- The git history will be evaluated.
- Your code will be evaluated by: semantics, structure, legibility, size, elegance (among other factors).
